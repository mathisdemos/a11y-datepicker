# a11y-datepicker

This is an early work in progress datepicker component.

It aims to be accessible to keyboard and screenreader users.

It should be small.

It does not have any external dependencies.

## Roadmap

- support custom icons
- add a control bar for closing the datepicker and getting to the current date
- move necessary css to js
- add some missing aria controls
- add documentation
- add more tests
